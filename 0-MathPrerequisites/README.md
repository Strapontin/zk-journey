# Math Prerequisites

This section is optional but can be helpful. Having a strong math background is good leverage to learn ZK, but it is not a necessary prerequisite: https://x.com/Jeyffre/status/2001738100704448929?s=20

## Overall Courses That May Give An Edge

- Linear Algebra
- Discrete Math (with Elementary Number Theory)
- Proofs (prerequisite for Group Theory)
- Group Theory
- Porobability/Stats
- Computational Theory/Complexity
- Rust (90% of ZK projects use Rust)
- Cryptography
- Algebraic Coding Theory
- VM/Computer Architecture
